# Test MU Plugins

This directory contains mu-plugins used during Cypress E2E testing. These files are dynamically created by the test suite to test various filter scenarios.

Files in this directory are:
- Created automatically during test runs
- Mapped to the WordPress environment via `.wp-env.json`
- Should not be committed to version control (except this README)
